# 🧠 Learning Lab

Welcome to my personal learning repository! I'm a **Software Engineer** with a passion for continuous growth. This space serves as a living archive of my learning journey through various technologies, courses, bootcamps, and side projects.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository is organized to reflect different learning areas, each stored in a dedicated folder. Below is a breakdown of the current structure:

### Main Branch


The main branch contains general-purpose materials not tied to any specific course or bootcamp. You’ll find:

- ✨ Code snippets for algorithms, data structures, or design patterns  
- 🧪 Experiments with tools, libraries, and frameworks  
- 🗒️ Notes and mini-projects from self-guided exploration  
- 💼 Personal coding challenges or interview prep content  

## 🌿 Branches for Bootcamps, Courses & Projects

I'll be using Git branches to separate long-term learning tracks, bootcamps, or structured courses. Here's a description of each:

- `bootcamp-name-branch` – Notes, exercises, and projects from a specific bootcamp
- `course-name-branch` – Organized content for a course (e.g., Coursera, Udemy, CS50)
- `project-xyz` – A focused branch to build and iterate on a specific project or idea

## 📚 How I Organize Learning Content

### For Courses & Bootcamps
Each branch includes:

- A dedicated `README.md` summarizing the course, goals, and progress  
- Structured folders per module, week, or topic  
- Markdown notes or Jupyter notebooks for key concepts  
- Exercises, homework, and final projects  
- Links to certificates or official course descriptions (when applicable)  

## 🚧 In Progress

This repository is continuously updated as I explore new technologies and deepen my knowledge. Expect to see:

- New branches for upcoming courses and projects  
- Refactoring and organizing of older content  
- More documentation and learning summaries
