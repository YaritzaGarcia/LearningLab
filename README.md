## 🌿 Branches for Bootcamps, Courses & Projects

I'll be using Git branches to separate long-term learning tracks, bootcamps, or structured courses. Here's a description of each:

- `bootcamp-name-branch` – Notes, exercises, and projects from a specific bootcamp
- `course-name-branch` – Organized content for a course (e.g., Coursera, Udemy, CS50)
- `project-xyz` – A focused branch to build and iterate on a specific project or idea
